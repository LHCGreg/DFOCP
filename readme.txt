BrowserlessDFOgui.exe is the graphical version.

BrowserlessDFO.bat is a batch file you can edit to put in your username and password so all you have to do is double-click BrowserlessDFO.bat without having to enter your username and password anymore. Make sure you understand the risks of storing a password in a file on your computer.
