BrowserlessDFO.bat is a batch file you can edit to put in your username and password so all you have to do is double-click BrowserlessDFO.bat without having to enter your username and password anymore. Make sure you understand the risks of storing a password in a file on your computer. If you choose to use this method, open BrowserlessDFO.bat in a text editor like Notepad, follow the directions inside, and save it. You can then double-click BrowerlessDFO.bat to log in without entering your username and password anymore.


If you wish to log in from the command-line or from a script, the usage is:
