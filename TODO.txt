Resizing DFO window
Bug: DFOCP thinks the game has ended when the game patches. DFOCP assumes that DFO.exe should be running after the DFOLauncher.exe ends, but LauncherUpdator.exe might be running instead.
More user-friendly error messages
Option for killing news popups?
Cancel button?
Option to leave program open after game is done (GUI only, makes no sense with command-line)?
Stop as soon as game is up if not closing popup or switching soundpacks?
