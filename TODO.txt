Request to be run as admin on systems with UAC.
UI issue: Window size slider is enabled even when the "start windowed" checkbox is not checked.
Make window size UI better for people with multiple monitors, maybe use maximum size of any monitor as the maximum size allowed.
Bug: DFOCP thinks the game has ended when the game patches. DFOCP assumes that DFO.exe should be running after the DFOLauncher.exe ends, but LauncherUpdator.exe might be running instead.

Option for killing news popups?
Remove command-line version and instead use the GUI with an -autorun switch or something?
Option to leave program open after game is done (GUI only, makes no sense with command-line)?
Stop as soon as game is up if not closing popup or switching soundpacks?
